My Projects while pursuing my Data Science passion ;3

### 1. Blood Cell Detection ðŸ©¸ (November 2023 - now)

**Location**: [link here](https://github.com/EveTLynn/Blood-Type-Detection)

**Description**: This project implements fine-tuning of a RetinaNet model with a ResNet-50 backbone from the [TensorFlow Model Garden (TFM)](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) for detecting three types of blood cells (Red Blood Cells (RBCs), White Blood Cells (WBCs), and Platelets) in microscopic images from the [BCCD dataset](https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD_Dataset).

### 2. Packt Data Analysis Workshop (December 2023 - now)

**Location**: [link here](https://github.com/EveTLynn/Packt-Data-Analysis-Workshop)

**Description**: I haven't finish this one. 3 more chapters to go. The first 2-3 chapters have some useful techniques but it's quite repetitive for the next few ones. 
I'm adding some of my own analysis and also try some Machine Learning.


### 3. Quantium Virtual Internship - Retail Strategy and Analytics (August 2023 - September 2023)

**Location**: In this repository [link here](https://github.com/EveTLynn/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Quatium-Retails-Analytics-Job-Simulation)

**Description**: This project is for Quatium Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage involving the following tasks:
- Analyzed customer and transaction data to identify customer purchasing behaviors and generate commercial recommendations
- Used statistical testing to identify benchmark stores that reflected the prior performance of selected trial stores
- Compared the performance of trial stores and control stores after implementing new store layouts, resulting in significant uplift in sales and customer visits during the trial period

Pretty good hands-on on how to apply statistical testing and implementing actions in retail scenarios.


### 4. PowerCo churn problem and discount impact (July - August 2023)

**Location**: In this repository [link here](https://github.com/EveTLynn/Personal_Projects/tree/main/BCG-Virtual_Experience_Program)

**Description**: BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program on Forage

### 5. Marketing Campaign Acceptance Prediction (Feburary - March 2023)

**Location**: In this repository [link here](https://github.com/EveTLynn/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/VEF_DA_2022.04_FinalProject_MarketingCampaign)

**Description**: My final project for VEF Academy's Python for Data Analytics Course. My first ever project after a few months of coding and learning data. 
It sucks, I know !! ðŸ˜¤ But it got me started so I'll keep it.
