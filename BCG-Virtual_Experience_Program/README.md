### This is a Project for BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program on Forage.

[link to the program here!](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/Tcz8gTtprzAS4xSoK?ref=dDsCRiLXErJmXtsZq)

The program consists of 4 main tasks:
1. Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering & Modelling
4. Findings & Recommendations

## Context of the project
The context involved a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers called PowerCo.
The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. 
They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers. 
A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, 
for which a good predictive model could be useful. 
Moreover, for those customers that are at risk of churning, a discount might incentivize them to stay with our client. 
The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).

I will be playing as a role of a data scientist at BCG and tackle this problem.
