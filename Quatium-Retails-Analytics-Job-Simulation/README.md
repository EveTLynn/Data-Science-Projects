**The program includes 3 tasks:**
- Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
- Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing
- Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

## Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics
### 1.1. Background information
Quantium’s retail analytics team and have been approached by a client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. The insights from the analysis will feed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

**Main tasks**
- Examine transaction data – look for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. 
- Examine customer data – check for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls and when you are happy merge the transaction and customer data together.
- Data analysis and customer segments – define the metrics – look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explore the data, create charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights.
- Deep dive into customer segments – define your recommendation from insights, determine which segments we should be targeting, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on your analysis.
